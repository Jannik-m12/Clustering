ðŸš€ Practice Activity
Conduct a data fitness assessment for your capstone clustering project by creating a detailed evaluation matrix with the following components:
Objective Mapping Table: List your specific clustering objectives in rows and available datasets in columns. Rate alignment (1-5 scale) and note gaps or concerns for each objective-dataset combination.
Coverage Analysis: Calculate representation rates for key subgroups (geographic areas, demographic categories, time periods). Identify systematic underrepresentation and document potential impacts on clustering validity.
Quality Dashboard: For each dataset, compute and visualize completeness rates, temporal coverage, and consistency indicators. Create plots showing missing data patterns and quality variation across subgroups.
Integration Assessment: If using multiple datasets, document joining keys, overlap rates, and potential conflicts. Plan strategies for handling discrepancies between sources.
Capstone Connection
Document your data fitness assessment in DATA_FITNESS_ASSESSMENT.md within your project repository. This analysis justifies your dataset choices, acknowledges limitations, and provides transparency for stakeholders evaluating your clustering insights. Include specific mitigation strategies for identified gaps and quality concerns.
