ðŸš€ Practice Activity
Complete final data preparation for your capstone clustering project:
Feature Selection Finalization: Based on all previous analysis, select your final feature set for clustering. Document rationale for including each feature and create feature importance ranking.
Multi-Version Dataset Creation: Prepare different dataset versions for comprehensive analysis, interpretability focus, and algorithm comparison. Test each version with basic clustering to ensure compatibility.
Validation Framework Setup: Create holdout datasets and validation protocols for testing preprocessing consistency and clustering stability. Document validation procedures for stakeholder review.
Documentation and Packaging: Create comprehensive data documentation, save all preparation artifacts, and establish procedures for applying your preprocessing pipeline to new data.
Capstone Connection
Finalize your clustering dataset preparation with comprehensive documentation in DATA_PREPARATION_FINAL.md. Include dataset versions, validation protocols, and clear instructions for stakeholder use and ongoing analysis updates.
