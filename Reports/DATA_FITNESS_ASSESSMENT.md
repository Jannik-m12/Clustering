# DATA FITNESS ASSESSMENT

## Project: ESG & Financial Performance Clustering

**Purpose:**  
This assessment documents the fitness of the available dataset for conducting clustering analysis of ESG and financial performance. It focuses on dataset alignment with project objectives and known characteristics. Metrics such as completeness, coverage, and consistency will need to be quantified once the dataset is loaded.

## 1. Objective Mapping Table

| **Clustering Objective** | **Relevant Dataset Features / Columns** | **Alignment Notes** |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Identify ESG Leaders vs Laggards | ESG_Overall, ESG_Environmental, ESG_Social, ESG_Governance | Directly supports differentiation based on sustainability performance. |
| Detect Industry-Specific Patterns | Industry, Revenue, ProfitMargin, MarketCap, ESG sub-scores | Industry and financial metrics enable segmentation; all 9 industries represented. |
| Evaluate Regional Performance Trends | Region, Revenue, ProfitMargin, ESG_Overall | 7 regions included; geographic clustering feasible. |
| Assess ESG-Financial Trade-offs | Revenue, ProfitMargin, MarketCap, ESG_Overall, ESG sub-scores | Both financial and ESG metrics are present to analyze synergies and trade-offs. |
| Track Improvement Trajectories (2015–2025) | Year, ESG_Overall, ESG sub-scores, Revenue, GrowthRate | Temporal dimension exists; longitudinal analysis possible, though actual data completeness per year is unknown. |

**Notes:**  
- All variables needed for clustering are present.  
- Exact coverage of each variable and subgroup will need to be confirmed via exploratory data analysis.

## 2. Dataset Overview

**Columns and Descriptions:**  

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CompanyID | Unique identifier for each synthetic company |
| CompanyName | Synthetic company name (e.g., "Company_123") |
| Industry | Industry sector (e.g., Technology, Finance, Energy) |
| Region | Geographic region (e.g., North America, Europe) |
| Year | Reporting year (2015–2025) |
| Revenue | Annual revenue (millions USD) |
| ProfitMargin | Net profit margin (%) |
| MarketCap | Market capitalization (millions USD) |
| GrowthRate | Year-over-year revenue growth (%) |
| ESG_Overall | Aggregate ESG score (0–100) |
| ESG_Environmental | Environmental sustainability score (0–100) |
| ESG_Social | Social responsibility score (0–100) |
| ESG_Governance | Governance quality score (0–100) |
| CarbonEmissions | Annual carbon emissions (tons CO₂) |
| WaterUsage | Annual water usage (cubic meters) |
| EnergyConsumption | Annual energy consumption (MWh) |

**Observations:**  
- Dataset includes financial, ESG, and operational metrics, enabling multi-dimensional clustering.  
- Temporal coverage allows trend and trajectory analysis (2015–2025).  
- Identifiers and categorical variables (Industry, Region) allow subgroup analysis.

## 3. Coverage & Quality Assessment

**Known Facts:**  
- The dataset contains 1,000 synthetic companies across 9 industries and 7 regions.  
- Variables cover financial performance, ESG dimensions, and resource usage.  
- Unique identifiers and Year column facilitate longitudinal and multi-source integration.

**Unknown / To Be Assessed:**  
- Completeness (missing values) for each variable.  
- Temporal coverage per company and per ESG sub-score.  
- Data consistency and plausibility checks (e.g., Revenue vs GrowthRate, ESG sub-scores vs ESG_Overall).  
- Representation of small-cap companies or underrepresented regions.

**Next Steps:**  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to quantify missing data, validate ranges, and detect anomalies.  
- Generate visualizations for missing data patterns and subgroup coverage.

---

## 4. Integration Assessment

**Known Facts:**  
- Dataset is self-contained with all required identifiers (CompanyID, CompanyName, Year, Industry, Region).  
- Columns are sufficient to merge with other datasets if additional operational or financial data are sourced in the future.

**Unknown / To Be Assessed:**  
- Conflicts or mismatches if joined with other datasets.  
- Overlap of companies and years with external sources.

**Recommendation:**  
- Standardize identifiers before integration.  
- Document assumptions and transformations for reproducibility.

## 5. Mitigation Strategies

Once the dataset is loaded and EDA performed, consider the following:  

1. **Data Completeness:** Impute missing values where necessary or exclude variables with substantial gaps.  
2. **Variable Standardization:** Scale financial, ESG, and operational metrics for clustering.  
3. **Subgroup Analysis:** Assess industry, region, and company size representation to avoid biased clusters.  
4. **Consistency Checks:** Verify that ESG sub-scores aggregate correctly to ESG_Overall and that GrowthRate aligns with Revenue changes.  
5. **Documentation:** Record all assumptions, imputations, and decisions for transparency.

## 6. Conclusion

The dataset is well-suited for the ESG & financial clustering project:

- Contains 1,000 companies with identifiers, temporal coverage (2015–2025), and multi-dimensional metrics (financial, ESG, operational).  
- Enables analysis of clusters based on ESG performance, financial outcomes, industry, and regional characteristics.  
- Further analysis is required to quantify coverage, completeness, and consistency for rigorous clustering.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Conduct full exploratory data analysis.  
- Visualize missing data and coverage across subgroups.  
- Apply mitigation strategies before performing clustering.
