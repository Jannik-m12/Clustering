ðŸš€ Practice Activity
Conduct a comprehensive data adequacy assessment for your capstone dataset through the following systematic analysis:
Variability Assessment: Calculate coefficient of variation for all numerical features. Create histograms showing distribution shapes and identify features with insufficient or excessive variation. Document which features may need transformation or exclusion.
Sample Size Analysis: Given your expected number of clusters and features, calculate minimum sample size requirements using the 50-100 observations per cluster guideline. Compare to your actual sample size and identify potential limitations.
Hopkins Statistic Calculation: Compute the Hopkins statistic for your full feature set to assess cluster tendency. Values significantly below 0.5 indicate good clustering potential, while values near 0.5 suggest random structure.
Missing Data Investigation: Create a missingness heatmap showing patterns across features and observations. Identify whether missing data appears random or systematic, and calculate impact on sample size for different handling strategies.
